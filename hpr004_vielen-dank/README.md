# HPR004 Vielen Dank

**Release Date:** 31.09.2021

## About
Half Past Vibe Records is pleased to share "Vielen Dank."

This release represents the culmination of over a year of work by HPR label co-founder [Dataist](https://mixcloud.com/dataist). This also marks the first full release on the label. Reflecting the experience of spending two years in a foreign land--with much of the experience spanning the global pandemic--this record is a fusion of the heavier and fast side of the local music scene with the softer and slower music of Dataist's roots. In short, this is the beginning of a love letter to Germany and all the wonderful people he met along the journey.

Our mission at `Half Past Vibe Records` is to develop and distribute *bleeding-edge auditory dance solutions*, to provide disc jockeys and electronic music professionals with the tools they need to deliver *effective, high-quality performances* and to engage their dancefloor customers.

We're here to remind you: **Just Be Yourself!**

## Usage
While many labels seem to be pivoting to different goals, HPR continues to stay true to our original mission: creating music for the dancefloor and its citizens.

This release is no exception. Every track was created with the dancer in mind. The high energy nature of this music should be applicable for nearly any setting where dancing is the goal. With this release we've also attempted to create a diversity of styles and sounds to give YOU, the dance music professional, as many options as possible.

* `lusttropfen` is heavily inspired by the house music of old. Joyous, lush, and at times very intense. The vocals, while a bit of an endurance trial, are meant to create a sense of nostalgia while pushing into glossolalia--placing the listener into a state of confusion by never fully understanding the content of the words. The hairy snares punch at strange times pushing towards chaotic rhythm while still adhering to a structure reminiscent of UKG. And all the while the synth is a sort of *proto-acid* melodic meme. This track should get your listeners moving their bodies anywhere between 22:00 to 3:00. 

* `handschuh` is an attempt to bridge *footwork* and a more classic house form. Again, vocals which do not penetrate the users consciousness directly but instead ride as a wave on top. The kick and bass push the track to feel fast while the overall BPM is slow. All the while a human played key section creates a sense of humanness. We recommend using this track to bridge between different tempos of music or as a way to get the dancefloor started.

* `alter` is a full attempt to fuse *techno* and *house* without falling into the uncomfortable space of *tech-house* (sorry tech-house fans). The synth lead follows the tradition which says: "a filter can be a main musical element." While single note bassline pushes against the kick to emulate rolling *techno* the track progresses the energy builds culminating in a breakdown which drops into a double time hat which is like realizing your car's transmission has another gear that you didn't know it had. This track is ideal for peak-time when you see that the crowd is ready to start going a little bit harder.
