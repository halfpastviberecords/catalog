**Release Date:** 06.12.2019

## About
Half Past Vibe Records is pleased to share "Some Edits For You!"
This is our second product, and includes a collection of remixes and edits by Wax Mathews. Using state-of-the-art product development tooling, we have carefully crafted, optimized and tuned these recordings for peak-time dancefloor deployment.

Our mission at `Half Past Vibe Records` is to develop and distribute *bleeding-edge auditory dance solutions*, to provide disc jockeys and electronic music professionals with the tools they need to deliver *effective, high-quality performances* and to engage their dancefloor customers.

We're here to remind you: **Just Be Yourself!**

## Usage
With field research spanning over the past three years, Wax Mathews (with the help of Dataist) developed, unit tested and refined these AIFF files, both on the dancefloor and in the studio, to ensure optimal dancefloor response. We think you'll like the results!

The tracks are compatible with most modern electronic dance music delivery infrastructure, and require no additional configuration - simply download and play.

* `Tips (Wax Mathews 2019 Mix)` is a rolling house rendition of Bridal Party's 2017 indie-pop number, featuring Juno synthesizer washes, shimmering guitars, and Suz Raudaschl's unique airy voice over a bed of finely-tuned drums and bass.
* `Vertigo (Virgo Edit) (Wax Mathews Edit)` is a modern take on Alan Braxe's 1997 French house banger, originally stripped down by Thomas Bangalter, and later carefully tuned, boosted and sculpted by Wax Mathews to optimize the track for modern soundsystems.
* `Study No. 33 (Wax Mathews Remix)` is a reimagining of Conlon Nancarrow's late 1960s composition for player piano, with the addition of bubbling acid lines, frenetic 909 drums and air-raid sirens to bring Nancarrow's composition to a modern audience.
* `Love Come Down (Wax Mathews Edit)` is a no-nonsense, straighforward beef-up of Evelyn "Champagne" King's 1982 R&B hit, wherein the addition of snappy drums and a pitch-up operation has transformed the track into a peaktime house belter.
