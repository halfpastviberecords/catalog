## About
`Half Past Vibe` is a collection of producers working together to create next generation grooves for augmenting the late night dance experience.

Our mission is to provide the very best in dance music to get the vibe up and get people movin'. To do this, we utilize the latest, bleeding-edge advancements in neural networks and algorithms combined with the interconnecting power of the internet. We strive to provide the highest quality and most salient beats for dancers to move their feet. All this in order to help facilitate a space of freedom and equality on the dance floor.

We want everyone who's listening to remember: Just Be Yourself.
